One of the things I'm most guilty of is getting lost in the process of finding the 'perfect' answer to an issue. *What's the best, most efficient solution to the problem I'm having?*

This pursuit of efficiency has cost me quite a lot of time and energy, because although there are endless perfectly efficient and beautifully well-suited solutions to so many problems, I rarely am 100% ready to use those solutions when I need them. So I forego tackling the problem, or I lose time and energy in trying to implement the perfect solution. 

This is all to say that I'll be using Jekyll to get a little blog and site up and running here in GitHub. I knew about Jekyll for a little while, but thought that it would be better to plan something custom. 

But if I were to plan something custom, then should I use my everyday working language and framework? Or wouldn't it be better to use the language that I want to maintain my skills in and transition back to when I have the opportunity? Or, better yet! I could take this as a valuable opportunity to learn a new language, one which would unlock the door towards better and more plentiful opportunities! 

In the end, lots of hopes, lots of ideas, and no writing or visible progress forward. 

One of the things I *have* improved at lately is recognizing these cycles in myself and others, and using those moments of recognition as opportunities to sidestep them. It has come in quite handy. 

Next steps are to keep in the habit of writing about things I find interesting, worthwhile tangents I've explored, and issues I've resolved. But by dropping the barrier to writing in the first place is a good first step. It took me more time to pick a theme than it did to get Jekyll up and running locally.
