<p>This pursuit of efficiency has cost me quite a lot of time and energy, because although there are endless perfectly efficient and beautifully well-suited solutions to so many problems, I rarely am 100% ready to use those solutions when I need them. So I forego tackling the problem, or I lose time and energy in trying to implement the perfect solution.</p>

<p>This is all to say that I’ll be using Jekyll to get a little blog and site up and running here in GitHub. I knew about Jekyll for a little while, but thought that it would be better to plan something custom.</p>

<p>But if I were to plan something custom, then should I use my everyday working language and framework? Or wouldn’t it be better to use the language that I want to maintain my skills in and transition back to when I have the opportunity? Or, better yet! I could take this as a valuable opportunity to learn a new language, one which would unlock the door towards better and more plentiful opportunities!</p>

<p>In the end, lots of hopes, lots of ideas, and no writing or visible progress forward.</p>

<p>One of the things I <em>have</em> improved at lately is recognizing these cycles in myself and others, and using those moments of recognition as opportunities to sidestep them. It has come in quite handy.</p>

<p>Next steps are to keep in the habit of writing about things I find interesting, worthwhile tangents I’ve explored, and issues I’ve resolved. But by dropping the barrier to writing in the first place is a good first step. It took me more time to pick a theme than it did to get Jekyll up and running locally.</p>]]></content><author><name>Caroline Jeffra</name></author><category term="thoughts" /><category term="Jekyll" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the things I’m most guilty of is getting lost in the process of finding the ‘perfect’ answer to an issue.
